# Storm-Identification
With this code hourly precipitation data can be summarized into a list of precipitation events. The resulting list will include a numeric storm name alongside the duration of each storm. This is a hindsight classification written for an area which experiences hurricanes and norâ€™easters, as well as stagnant coastal fronts. The research site is undeveloped and includes a single meteorological station for the region. This project makes up for the low distribution of recording stations by aggregating storms based on their occurrence and the average wind speed during precipitation events.
